Studio 60's countdown clock
=================================

A countdown clock for your browser, likened to the one in the TV show "Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"
Written by [Nic](http://www.nicolashoening.de/) and [Jan](http://www.yanzen.de/).

Inspired by [Wes Mendell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Mendell)'s crazy
countdown clock in [Studio 60](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_60_on_the_Sunset_Strip).
Set your own deadline and see it being counted down!

In order to look like it should (see above), the clock thankfully uses the fonts
