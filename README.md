Studio 60's countdown clock
=================================

A countdown clock for your browser. Set your own deadline and see it being counted down, in style.

![The way it looked like in the show](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20061012014509/studio60/images/3/3e/Time_remaining.jpg)


Inspiration
-------------
This clock is inspired by [Wes Mendell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Mendell)'s crazy countdown clock in the TV show ["Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485842/). It was made by [Nic](http://www.nicolashoening.de/) and [Jan](http://www.yanzen.de/).


Usage
------

First, clone this repo:

$ git clone https://github.com/nhoening/Studio60CountdownClock

Then, simply point your browser to `index.html` and provide any of these URL parameters:

* title (default, as in the TV show, is "TIME REMAINING")
* year
* month
* day
* hour
* minute

Et voila:

Thanks

In order to look like it should (see above), the clock thankfully uses the fonts

* [Dot Matrix](http://www.dafont.com/dot-matrix.font) by [Svein KÃ¥re Gunnarson](http://www.dionaea.com/information/fonts.html)
* [Digit](http://www.dafont.com/digit.font) (by paldave)

As it stands, the clock requires a CSS3 - compatible browser to render these fonts.
